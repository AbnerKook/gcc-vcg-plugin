The plugin requires gcc-4.5.0 version or later, which supports the plugin
features. To install it, run the following commands,

mkdir build-vcg-plugin 
cd build-vcg-plugin
/path/to/gcc-vcg-plugin/configure --prefix=/path/to/install
make
make install

# Usage #
#########

First, a vcg viewer tool is required. See http://code.google.com/p/vcgviewer
or http://www.absint.com/aisee. 

The pre-defined vcg plugin commands can be used. Rename file "vcg.gdbinit" to
".gdbinit" or add "source vcg.gdbinit" in your original ".gdbinit".

Use one term as output screen, suppose /dev/pts/2.

Here's an example about how to use vcg-plugin in gdb: 

  gdb -tty /dev/pts/2 -q -args /path/to/cc1 test.c -fplugin=/path/to/vcg.so -O2 

  gdb) b a_point_of_gimple_pass 
  gdb) r 
  gdb) view_cfg 

Also, you can use -fplugin-arg-vcg-viewer=vcgview (xvcg, or aisee3) to select vcg
viewer, default is vcgview.
