# Usage #
#########

First, a vcg viewer tool is required. See http://code.google.com/p/vcgviewer
or http://www.absint.com/aisee. 

The pre-defined vcg plugin commands can be used. Rename file
"vcg-plugin.gdbinit" to ".gdbinit" or add "source vcg-plugin.gdbinit"
in your original ".gdbinit".

Here's an example about how to use vcg-plugin in gdb: 

  gdb -q -args /path/to/cc1 test.c -fplugin=/path/to/vcg-plugin.so -O2 

  gdb) b a_point_of_gimple_pass 
  gdb) r 
  gdb) view_function current_function_decl

Also, you can use -fplugin-arg-vcg-viewer=vcgview (xvcg, or aisee3) to select vcg
viewer, default is vcgview.
